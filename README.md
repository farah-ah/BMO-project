# 🟩 BMO Interactive Model Project

This project brings **BMO** from *Adventure Time* to life using **digital logic, physical circuitry, and embedded programming**.  
It combines 3D design, electronics, and code to create an interactive, standalone version of BMO that can display animations, facial expressions, and play the show’s intro song.

---

## ✨ Features
- 🖥️ Custom 3D-printed BMO shell with mounted components  
- 🎨 TFT display showing BMO’s face and text animations  
- 💾 SD card storage for images and audio files  
- 🔊 Speaker output for the *Adventure Time* intro theme  
- 🔘 Button-controlled interactions and LED feedback  
- 🔋 Battery-powered for full portability  

---

## 🧠 Built With
- **Microcontroller:** Arduino / ESP32  
- **Programming Language:** C++ (Arduino IDE)  
- **Hardware:** SPI TFT display, SD card module, speaker, buttons, LEDs  
- **Design Tools:** 3D modeling and printing software  

---

## 🎯 Project Goal
To merge knowledge of **digital logic design**, **circuit building**, and **microcontroller programming** into one creative, functional project inspired by BMO from *Adventure Time*.

---

## 📂 Repository Contents
- `3D_Model/` – STL files for printing the BMO shell  
- `Code/` – Arduino or ESP32 source code  
- `Assets/` – SD card files (faces, sounds, etc.)  
- `Docs/` – Circuit diagrams, wiring plans, and documentation  

---

## 🪫 Power and Portability
The project is powered by a rechargeable **Li-ion / LiPo battery** with a **TP4056 charging circuit** and **5V boost converter**, allowing BMO to run completely untethered.

---

## 🧩 Future Enhancements
- Add motion or touch sensors for more interactivity  
- Include voice or sound response  
- Implement wireless (Wi-Fi / Bluetooth) features  
- Develop a simple menu or game interface
